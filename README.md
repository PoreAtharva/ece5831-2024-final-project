## Introduction

**Course:** ECE 5831 - Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks  
**Instructor:** Professor Jaerock Kwon  
**Group Members:**  
- Aishwarya Dekhane ([adekhane@umich.edu](mailto:adekhane@umich.edu))  
- Shubhang Vangari ([shubbu@umich.edu](mailto:shubbu@umich.edu))  
- Atharva Pore ([atharva@umich.edu](mailto:atharva@umich.edu))  

This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos using advanced machine learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Additional methods like optical flow and facial landmark detection are leveraged to identify inconsistencies, ensuring robust detection of manipulated media.

## Project Proposal

### Abstract
This project aims to combat the misuse of deepfake technology by developing a robust detection system. Techniques such as CNNs (Inception, VGG16), RNNs, optical flow analysis, and facial landmark detection are used to detect spatial and temporal inconsistencies in videos. The system focuses on enhancing media authenticity and public trust.

### Motivation
Deepfake technology poses significant ethical, legal, and societal risks. Detecting manipulated videos is crucial to combat misinformation, identity fraud, and privacy breaches.

### Prior Work
- CNN architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, MesoNet) for spatial analysis.
- RNNs and LSTMs for temporal inconsistencies.
- Advanced techniques like attention mechanisms, transformers, and optical flow.

### Goals
- Develop a detection pipeline combining spatial and temporal analysis.
- Integrate advanced methods like optical flow and facial landmark detection.
- Achieve high accuracy on the DFDC dataset.

### Deliverables
- A complete detection system (codebase).
- Presentation video summarizing project outcomes.
- A final IEEE-format project report.
